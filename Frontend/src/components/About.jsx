        <h1>WHO WE ARE</h1>
        <p className="abstract">In the contemporary job market, effective interview preparation is pivotal for candidates
        striving to secure their desired positions. "Interview Trainer" is a innovative platform
        designed to address this need by providing a unique space where both interviewers and
        interviewees can actively participate in the interview preparation process. This platform,
        developed by Evercome, offers a dynamic solution to enhance the readiness of job seekers.
        The platform facilitates the registration of both interviewers and interviewees, creating a
        diverse pool of professionals from various domains. For interviewees, a distinctive feature of
        "Interview Trainer" is the ability to select their own interviewer based on specific criteria such
        as industry expertise, company background, or interview style. This personalized approach
        ensures that candidates can tailor their mock interview experiences to closely mirror the
        challenges they may face in real job interviews.
        Interviewers, comprising seasoned professionals and industry experts, have the opportunity
        to contribute to the growth of the workforce by offering their valuable insights and guidance.
        By allowing interviewees to choose their preferred interviewer, the platform creates a more
        collaborative and targeted preparation experience, fostering a sense of empowerment and
        control for the candidates.
        The platform offers a user-friendly interface where interviewees can schedule mock
        interviews, receive detailed feedback, and track their progress over time. Interviewers, on
        the other hand, can showcase their expertise, build a professional network, and contribute to
        the professional development of aspiring candidates.
        "Interview Trainer" not only serves as a practical tool for interview preparation but also
        establishes a community-driven approach to skill development. By bridging the gap between
        interviewers and interviewees, the platform strives to create a supportive ecosystem that
        benefits both parties and ultimately contributes to a more competent and prepared workforce
        in the competitive job market
